<h3>CSS</h3>
<p>
  Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a language that describes
  how a markup language is actually displayed [1].
  It is mainly used in HTML and XHTML, and can also be used in XML.
  It is a W3C standard, and the degree of freedom in defining layout
  and style is high. If the markup language (ex: HTML) is responsible
  for the body of the website, CSS is responsible
  for decorating it like clothes and accessories.
  In other words, you can decorate a website like a completely different
  website by changing the CSS file while leaving the HTML structure intact.
  In the case of CSS3, which is currently under development,
  functions that can replace images created with graphic editing programs
  such as shadow effects, gradients, and transformations have been added.
  In addition, various animation functions have been added,
  replacing Adobe Flash to some extent.
