JavaScript (English: JavaScript) is an object-based scripting programming
language. This language is mainly used within web browsers and
has the ability to access built-in objects of other applications.
It is also used for server programming, such as runtime environments
such as Node.js. JavaScript was originally developed by Brendan Eich
of Netscape Communications Corporation under the name Mocha and later
as LiveScript, and eventually became JavaScript. Although JavaScript
has a similar syntax to Sun Microsystems' Java, in fact, both languages ​​
are based on the basic syntax of the C language, and Java and JavaScript
are not directly related. Other than the name and syntax,
it has more similarities to Self and Scheme than Java.
JavaScript is recognized as the language that best implements the
standard specification of ECMAScript. It was basically supported
in most browsers up to ECMAScript 5 (ES5), but from ECMAScript 6 onwards,
it is compiled with a transpiler for browser compatibility.
