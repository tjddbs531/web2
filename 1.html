<h3>html</h3>
<p>
  HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the dominant markup language for
  web pages. HTML also provides a way to create structured documents
  with links, citations, and other items, as well as representing
  structural meaning for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, etc.
  And it can be used to embed images and objects and create interactive
  forms. HTML is written in the form of HTML elements consisting of
  "tags" enclosed in angle brackets within the content of a web page.
  HTML can contain or load JavaScript, which affects the behavior
  of HTML processing devices, such as web browsers, and CSS, which
  defines the appearance and placement of body and other items.
  The W3C, co-director of HTML and CSS standards, encourages the use
  of CSS for clear and expressive markup.
